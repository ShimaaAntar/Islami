## Fragment

A Fragment is a reusable part of your app's user interface. A fragment has its own layout, its own lifecycle, and can manage its own input events.

By dividing the UI into separate sections, fragments add modularity and reusability to your activity's UI. Activities are an excellent area to place global components such as a navigation drawer around your app's user interface. Fragments, on the other hand, are better suited to define and control the UI of a single screen or piece of a screen.

## Navigate between fragments using animations

The Fragment API provides two methods for visually connecting fragments during navigation by using motion effects and transformations.

## BottomNavigationView

Bottom navigation bars make it easy for users to explore and switch between top-level views in a single tap.

## Fragment lifecycle

Each instance of a Fragment has its own lifecycle. As a user navigates and interacts with your app, fragments go through several states in their lifecycle as they are added, removed, and enter or exit the screen.

## DialogFragment

A DialogFragment is a special fragment subclass that is designed for creating and hosting dialogs.
